This year UCNC will host three satellite workshops:

* Reaction Systems
* Quantum Computing
* Cellular Automata and Boolean Automata Networks

The workshops take place in the same rooms as the conference, but have their own schedules and committees. Registration will be offered either for a single workshop or for the full conference (including all workshops).
