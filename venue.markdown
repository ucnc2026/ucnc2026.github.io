_Piazza Unità d'Italia, Trieste main square_

Trieste is a lively and beautiful city on the sea in the north of Italy, surrounded by the mountains. It is the most "Mittel European" city in Italy, with a rich history and a glorious past of "Little Vienna by the Sea". Historically Trieste was a meeting point for many literary figures (e.g., James Joyce lived in Trieste for more than 10 years) and is nowadays the city with the highest density of academic researchers in Europe. Besides the University of Trieste, many academic institutions, including SISSA (International School for Advanced Studies), ICTP (International Centre for Theoretical Physics), INAF (Astrophysics observatory), OGS (Oceanography and Geophysics institute), and Area Science Park (technological park and tech transfer), form the so-called "Trieste System". Trieste was the European City of Science in 2020.

### The University of Trieste

The University of Trieste was founded in 1924. It has recently started a project to expand the computer science area. Its beautiful location on top of a hill right behind the city offers an amazing view on the Adriatic sea and on the surrounding mountains. The main building is easily accessible using the public transport in approximately 15 minutes from the city centre.
