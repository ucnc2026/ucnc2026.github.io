## Proceedings

Accepted regular and short papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series (LNCS) as post-proceedings.

## Paper Categories

The are four submission categories:

**regular papers**: they contain original research not yet communicated to other conference or any journal. Regular papers should not exceed 16 pages.

**short papers**: they are intended for communicating new original, not yet published research which is of smaller scope with respect to regular papers. Short papers should not exceed 8 pages and have shorter presentation time.

**late-breaking abstracts (LBA)** are informal presentations of new research and/or research direction proposals as well as presentations of research that has already been presented at other conferences, with the purpose of further dissemination of results or research directions. They should not exceed 3 pages.

**posters**: Posters should be one page in A0 format (plus 1 page abstract).

## Author Guidelines

Papers must not be under simultaneous consideration by any other conference with published proceedings.
All accepted papers, late-breaking abstracts, and posters must be presented at the conference by at least one registered author.

Please note that these guidelines apply only to the main conference track; [satellite workshops](workshops.html) have their own submission procedures and publication arrangements.

## Papers Preparation

Papers must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF) and must be formatted in the [LNCS style](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
Authors using LaTeX can download the needed macros at Springer-Verlag site.
Papers must respect the page limits announced above; full proofs and additional material may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which can be read by the reviewers.

Authors are invited to submit original research papers through the EasyChair submission system: _link available soon_.

## Special Issue
