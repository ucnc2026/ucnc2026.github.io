## Conference Info

The International Conference Series on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation (UCNC) provides a forum bringing together scientists from many different backgrounds who are interested in novel forms of computation, human-designed computation inspired by nature, and computational aspects of natural processes.

The 23rd International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation (UCNC 2026) will be held at the University of Trieste in Trieste, Italy, from June 22, 2026 to June 26, 2026. It will continue the tradition of focusing on current important theoretical and experimental developments and their critical evaluation.
