## G. Rozenberg Natural Computing Award

The G. Rozenberg Natural Computing Award is an award granted annually. It recognizes outstanding achievements in the field of Natural Computing.

The award is named after Grzegorz Rozenberg to acknowledge his distinguished scientific achievements in many areas of science, including Natural Computing, as well as his crucial role in developing the UCNC conference series. He also invented the name and defined the scope of the Natural Computing area.

The 2023 G. Rozenberg Natural Computing Award was presented to Professor _Jarkko Kari_ (University of Turku, Finland) in recognition of his outstanding contributions to cellular automata and, more generally, to the theory of dynamical systems. He is also a research leader in the theory of tilings, and his applications of tilings to cellular automata are truly masterful. Contributions by Professor Jarkko Kari significantly influenced the development of cellular automata.

The 2024 G. Rozenberg Natural Computing Award was presented to Professor _Susan Stepney_ (University of York, UK) in recognition of her outstanding research contributions to many areas of Natural Computing and Unconventional Computing. Among others, she is a research leader in reservoir computing. Her continuous research contributions and her service to the scientific community significantly influenced the development of the field of Natural Computing.

The 2025 G. Rozenberg Natural Computing Award was presented to professor Professor _Eric Goles_ (University Adolfo Ibañes, Santiago, Chile) in recognition of his numerous and important contributions to Natural
Computing and Unconventional Computing. He is a research leader on complex systems and cellular automata.
